## Introduction  

Terminal based simple Breakout game with Convolutional Neural Network. With my old mac-pro, it needs to take at lease 30 minutes to see that the bar is moving to try to bounce the ball.  

## How to build and run  

	$ mkdir build 
	$ cd build

	build$ cmake ..
	build$ make 

	// run 
	build$ ./breakout 2		// 1 for man control, 2 for AI  
	
Don't forget to add **the parameter 2** when you run this application. 

## Result  

After about 1 hour training, the result is quite amazing for me. Look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZsvcmMW5I).
