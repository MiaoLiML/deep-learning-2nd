## Introduction  

[All previous neural net studies](https://github.com/supertigim/deep.learning) are rewritten by using tiny-dnn. It will help me to test an advanced algorithm easily. Also, there is python source code with tensorflow in python-tf directory which comes from online lectures by professor [Sunghun Kim](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~hunkim/) at HKUST.
